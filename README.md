# 🌴 Summer Travellers – My First Website

This is a simple **travel booking form** I created while learning HTML and CSS.  
It collects personal information, travel details, and basic payment info in a clean and organized layout.  

I took help from ChatGPT for the CSS part to understand how styling and alignment work,  
but I made sure to go through every line of code and learn *why* each part is used.

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to structure a form using HTML tags like `input`, `label`, and `select`.
- The purpose of different input types (`text`, `email`, `date`, `radio`, etc.).
- How to center and align elements using CSS.
- How to upload a website to **GitHub Pages** and make it viewable online.

## ✨ About This Project
This project is not about perfection — it’s about **learning and improving**.  
I want to keep my early projects simple so that in the future, I can look back and see how much I’ve improved as a developer.
